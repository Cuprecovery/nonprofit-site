<h2>Our Stories & Testimonies</h2>

<p>
  At CUP-RECOVERY, our foundation is built on real lives transformed by the power of God.
  Many of us have personally walked through addiction, brokenness, incarceration, and hopelessness.
  Through Jesus Christ, we have experienced freedom, restoration, and new purpose.


<p>
  These are not secondhand stories. They are lived testimonies of what God can and will do.
  We believe recovery is not just sobriety, but complete heart and life transformation through faith in Christ.
</p>

<h2>Training & Calling</h2>

<p>
  In obedience to God's calling, we are actively pursuing education and certification in
  <strong>peer support</strong> and <strong>case management</strong>.
  Our goal is to combine lived experience, professional training, and biblical truth
  to better serve men seeking lasting recovery.
</p>
Isaiah 40:31 - Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.
<p>
Ezekial 36:26 - I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you.
<p>
2 Corinthians 3:17 - Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
<p>

  By equipping ourselves with both faith-based principles and evidence-based support skills,
  we are preparing to walk alongside others with compassion, accountability, and practical guidance.
  Everything we do is centered on glorifying God (the father) Christ (the son) and the Holy Spirit and helping men rebuild their lives with purpose.
