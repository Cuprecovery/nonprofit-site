  “For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
  I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you clothed me,
  I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me…  
  Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers,
  you did it to me.”

 <h2>Matthew 25:31–46 (The Least Of These)</h2>

<p>
In this passage, Jesus teaches that when the Son of Man returns in glory, He will separate the righteous from the unrighteous based on how they responded to human need. Feeding the hungry, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, caring for the sick, and visiting those in prison are revealed not as optional acts of kindness, but as evidence of a transformed heart.
</p>

<p>
This teaching affirms that compassion, service, and obedience are central to the Christian life. What is done for the most vulnerable is counted by Christ as service done directly to Him.
</p>

<p><em>
“Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.”
</em><br>
<strong>— Matthew 25:40 (NKJV)</strong>
</p>
  
  <h2>Training & Calling</h2>

<p>
  In obedience to God's calling and the Great Commission, we are actively pursuing education and certification in
  <strong>case management</strong>.
 Our goal is to combine lived experience,coordinated resources, and biblical truth
  to better serve men seeking lasting recovery and spiritual transformation.
</p>

<ul class="values-list">
  <li><strong>Isaiah 40:31</strong> - "But those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint.[...]</li>
 <li><strong>Isaiah 58:10</strong> – "If you extend your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light shall dawn in the darkness, and your darkness shall be as the noonday."</li>
  <li><strong>2 Corinthians 3:17</strong> - "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</li>
  <li><strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> - "I can do all this through him who gives me strength."</li>
  <li><strong>Proverbs 22:9</strong> - "He who has a generous eye will be blessed, For he gives of his bread to the poor."</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By equipping ourselves with both faith-based principles and evidence-based support skills,
  we are preparing to walk alongside brothers with compassion, accountability, and practical guidance grounded in Scripture.
  Everything we do is centered on glorifying God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit—
  and helping men rebuild their lives with renewed purpose in Christ.
