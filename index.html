<h2 style="margin-top: 50px;">Our Stories & Testimonies</h2>

<p>
  At CUP-RECOVERY, our foundation is built on real lives transformed by the power of Jesus Christ.
  Many of us have personally walked through addiction, brokenness, incarceration, and hopelessness—
  places where worldly solutions failed and hope seemed impossible.
  Through Jesus Christ and His redemptive grace, we have experienced freedom, restoration, and new purpose.
</p>

<p>
  These are not secondhand stories. They are lived testimonies of what God can and will do.
  We believe recovery is not just sobriety, but complete heart and life transformation through faith in Jesus Christ.
  Our God specializes in impossibilities.

  <h2>Training & Calling</h2>

<p>
  In obedience to God's calling and the Great Commission, we are actively pursuing education and certification in
  <strong>peer support</strong> and <strong>case management</strong>.
 Our goal is to combine lived experience, professional training, and biblical truth
  to better serve men seeking lasting recovery and spiritual transformation.
</p>

<ul class="values-list">
  <li><strong>Isaiah 40:31</strong> - "But those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not faint.[...]</li>
  <li><strong>Ezekiel 36:26</strong> - "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh."</li>
  <li><strong>2 Corinthians 3:17</strong> - "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."</li>
  <li><strong>Philippians 4:13</strong> - "I can do all this through him who gives me strength."</li>
  <li><strong>Proverbs 27:12</strong> - "The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty."</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By equipping ourselves with both faith-based principles and evidence-based support skills,
  we are preparing to walk alongside brothers with compassion, accountability, and practical guidance grounded in Scripture.
  Everything we do is centered on glorifying God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son, and the Holy Spirit—
  and helping men rebuild their lives with renewed purpose in Christ.

    We don't just help men stop drinking or using. We help them find their identity in Christ,
    restore broken relationships, reclaim their purpose, and become the men God created them to be.

<div class="testimonial-section">
  <h3>A Life Restored</h3>
  <p class="testimonial-text">
    Recovery through Christ means more than sobriety. It means restoration of family relationships,
    healing from shame and guilt, discovering God's purpose, developing healthy biblical relationships,
    and growing in faith and spiritual maturity. Men graduate from our program as leaders, mentors,
    and brothers in Christ ready to serve their communities and families.

    "Jesus answered, 'Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them
    will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life.'"
